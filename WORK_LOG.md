While I love the opportunity to #usetheplatform and flex what browsers can accomplish natively nowadays, I feel that it is more demonstrative for me to use a framework that is similar to what we'd be building out with there. This also makes it easier to showcase my usage of Typescript. I'll be using Solid Start as it's an amazingly performant newcomer, with VDOM-free rendering similar to Svelte, but a more React-ish DX.
